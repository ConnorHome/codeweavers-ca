# Codeweavers / Cox Automotive Frontend Challenge

This is a React application built with Vite, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. There are some basic tests written with Vitest and React Testing Library.

You'll need to be running Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ to run this application.

Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
Run `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Assumptions & caveats

- I've assumed the prices are in GBP.
- I've assumed the mileage is in miles.
- The calculator is by no means bulletproof, but handles basic numeric input.
